## MUST

* make SR do something
* test whether deletion works
* bug: books are not getting updated in db when done

## SHOULD

* do the auto property fix when card is loaded basically anywhere, not on save
* write a better book selector
* reset tags for new cards
* less scary transition when new card
* display interval for habits etc.
* an empty tag seems to be generated sometimes (only for imported cards?)
